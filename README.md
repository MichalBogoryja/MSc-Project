# MSc-Project

[TOC]

## Introduction

The aims of this project are:

- design and build a docking station for e-puck robots with a Pi-puck extension board, 
- develop an algorithm for a whole swarm to detect the low level of batteries and to set the order of
  recharging robots.

## Features

The real robot should be able to:

- detect the docking station,
- avoid obstacles,
- dock autonomously. 

The algorithm for a whole swarm:

- each robot should control its own behaviour,
  - detect low level of a battery,
  - analyze information form other robots,
  - decide when return to the charging area,
- robots should execute a foraging task,
- charging area should not charge more robots than specified (default five).
